    """
    odin heavily caches resources. It does this by adding a resource to a resource
    registry the minute the resource gets initiated (__new__) --> metaclass.

    The cache/registry key is from the resource name(classname) and name_space (meta) combined.
    However, when a resource inherits from another resource, the namespace also gets inherited.

    This is problematic in context of oscar's `get_class` method, as the class name will be the same
    and since namespaces are inherited, this will also be the same. This results in odin returning the old resource class from
    the cache / registry.

    This class sets the namespace to NotProvided, odin will in this case generate the namespace
    from the module where the resource is defined. This will make sure that the namespace is unique
    for each resource, even if they inherit from each other.
